# Directives

### 1. What are the Directives in Angular?
### A.
Directives in Angular are classes that add behavior to elements in your Angular applications. They can change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive. There are three types of directives in Angular:
1. **Component Directives**: These are the most common directives, defined using the `@Component` decorator.
2. **Structural Directives**: These change the DOM layout by adding or removing elements, e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`.
3. **Attribute Directives**: These change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive, e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`.
